//! This library provides the `SeqLock` type, which is a form of reader-writer
//! lock that is heavily optimized for readers.
//!
//! In certain situations, `SeqLock` can be two orders of magnitude faster than
//! the standard library `RwLock` type. Another advantage is that readers cannot
//! starve writers: a writer will never block even if there are readers
//! currently accessing the `SeqLock`.
//!
//! The only downside of `SeqLock` is that it only works on types that are
//! `Copy`. This means that it is unsuitable for types that contains pointers
//! to owned data.
//!
//! You should instead use `RwLock` from the
//! [parking_lot](https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot) crate if you need
//! a reader-writer lock for types that are not `Copy`.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The implementation is based on the [Linux seqlock type](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/seqlock.h).
//! Each `SeqLock` contains a sequence counter which tracks modifications to the
//! locked data. The basic idea is that a reader will perform the following
//! operations:
//!
//! 1. Read the sequence counter.
//! 2. Read the data in the lock.
//! 3. Read the sequence counter again.
//! 4. If the two sequence counter values differ, loop back and try again.
//! 5. Otherwise return the data that was read in step 2.
//!
//! Similarly, a writer will increment the sequence counter before and after
//! writing to the data in the lock. Once a reader sees that the sequence
//! counter has not changed while it was reading the data, it can safely return
//! that data to the caller since it is known to be in a consistent state.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use seqlock::SeqLock;
//!
//! let lock = SeqLock::new(5);
//!
//! {
//!     // Writing to the data involves a lock
//!     let mut w = lock.lock_write();
//!     *w += 1;
//!     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
//! }
//!
//! {
//!     // Reading the data is a very fast operation
//!     let r = lock.read();
//!     assert_eq!(r, 6);
//! }
//! ```
